# Programming Languages

- Formal systems enabling humans to communicate instructions to computers for task execution.

---

# Machine Code

- Low-level programming language, binary code directly executable by a computer's CPU.

---

# Compiler/Interpreter

- Software tools with the capability to translate high-level programming code into machine code.

---

# Compiler

- **Build-time Operation:**
  - Executes on the build machine before deployment.

- **Execution Architecture Awareness:**
  - Limited knowledge of the execution machine architecture (e.g., x86, x64, ARM, RISC-V).

- **Independent Executables:**
  - Generates a standalone executable for deployment.

---

# Interpreter

- **Runtime Operation:**
  - Executes on the execution machine during runtime.

- **In-Depth Machine Insight:**
  - Possesses detailed knowledge of the machine architecture.

- **Startup Consideration:**
  - Significantly increases startup time due to interpretation.

- **Time Constraints on Optimization:**
  - Opportunities for optimization are limited by the time-intensive nature of the process.

# .NET Compilation Overview

::left::
### Compiler 

- **Code Translation:**
  - Translates high-level programming code into Intermediate Language (IL).
  - Supports languages: C#, F#, VB.NET, NetCOBOL for .NET, ...

- **Build-time Execution:**
  - Operates on the build machine before deployment.

::right::
### JIT (Just-In-Time) Compiler

- **Dynamic Translation:**
  - Translates IL into machine code on-the-fly.
  - x86, x64, arm, arm64, ...

- **Runtime Operation:**
  - Operates on the execution machine during runtime.

---

## C#
```csharp
static int Add(int left, int right)
    => left + right;
```

## IL
```
.method assembly hidebysig static int32 'Add' (int32 left, int32 right) cil managed 
{
    ldarg.0
    ldarg.1
    add
    ret
}
```

## ASM
```asm
lea eax, [rcx+rdx]
ret
```

# .NET Compilation: Advantages

- **Multilingual Support:**
  - Enables compatibility with multiple programming languages.

- **Cross-Language Utilization:**
  - Facilitates seamless use of libraries across different languages.

- **Efficient Deployment:**
  - Streamlines deployment by consolidating code into a single binary.

- **Performance Optimization:**
  - Enhances execution speed by optimizing code for the target machine architecture.

---

# JIT Compiler: Balancing Startup and Throughput

- **Optimization Dynamics:**
  - Optimizations consume time, leading to increased startup duration.

- **Tradeoff Consideration:**
  - Achieving better throughput often extends startup time, while prioritizing quicker startup may reduce overall throughput. 

---

# JIT Compiler: Usage Scenarios

- **Service Deployment:**
  - For services that start only once, several extra seconds of startup time are usually inconsequential.

- **Console Applications:**
  - In console applications with quick computations and swift exits, prioritizing minimized startup time is crucial.

---

# JIT Compiler: Tiered Compilation

- **Multiple Compilation Rounds:**
  - Employs the capability to compile the same code multiple times.

- **Initial Quick Compilation:**
  - First compilation prioritizes speed over extensive optimizations, producing fast but relatively unoptimized assembly code.

- **Instrumentation Integration:**
  - Introduces instrumentation into the assembly to monitor method call frequencies.

- **Selective Recompilation:**
  - Recompiles methods called frequently, applying comprehensive optimizations to enhance performance.

---

# JIT Compiler: On-Stack Replacement (OSR)

- **Loop Optimization Consideration:**
  - Methods called infrequently but executing repetitive work in a loop are identified.

- **Recompilation Trigger:**
  - After a certain number of loop iterations, the method undergoes recompilation.

- **Dynamic Runtime Replacement:**
  - Utilizes On-Stack Replacement (OSR) to seamlessly replace the method at runtime for improved efficiency.

# Conclusions

- **Versatile Compilation:**
  - .NET offers diverse compilation approaches to meet varying application needs.

- **Adaptive Performance:**
  - The JIT Compiler balances startup and throughput, adapting to usage scenarios.

- **Tiered Compilation Dynamics:**
  - JIT tiered compilation, including OSR, optimizes code based on runtime behavior.

- **Efficient SIMD Integration:**
  - Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD) enhances parallel execution for data-intensive tasks.

- **Continuous Evolution:**
  - .NET's compilation techniques evolve for optimized performance on modern hardware.

- **Tailored Efficiency:**
  - .NET's compilation tools provide tailored solutions for efficiency and adaptability.
